# üß™ Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

## üéØ Objective
This lab demonstrates how to perform a SQL injection UNION attack to extract data from a different table (`users`) and log in as the `administrator` user.

## üß≠ Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Lab
Launch the lab and take note of the goal: retrieve `username` and `password` from the `users` table.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intercept the Product Category Request
Use Burp Suite to click a category and intercept the request. Send it to Repeater.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Determine Column Count and Text Compatibility
Use this payload to test how many columns are returned and whether both accept text:
```
'+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'--
```

If the query works and the response is valid, it confirms two columns are returned and both accept string data.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve User Credentials
Inject the following UNION SELECT payload:
```
'+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--
```

The response should include usernames and passwords from the `users` table.
